# <p align="center">Osho chatbot Rag implementation sample </p>

## Overview
This project aims to create an AI-powered chatbot that mimics the conversational style and philosophical teachings of Osho, a renowned spiritual leader. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot provides contextually accurate responses derived from Osho's books and teachings stored as a knowledge base.


# Dataset 
The dataset is sourced by scraping the comprehensive collection of Osho's books available at https://www.alaalsayid.com/ebooks/OSHO%20pdf/.
These PDFs are preprocessed to extract clean, structured text suitable for embedding generation and efficient retrieval.

## âœ¨ Features  

**Knowledge Base Construction:**
Text from the books is converted into embeddings using a vectorizer (e.g., Sentence Transformers).
A vector database is employed to store the embeddings, enabling rapid retrieval of context-relevant information.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
Combines retrieval and generation to ground chatbot responses in Oshoâ€™s teachings.
The model first retrieves relevant excerpts from the vector database and incorporates them into dynamically generated responses, ensuring both relevance and coherence.

**Backend Development:**
Built using FastAPI, providing RESTful APIs for:
Querying the chatbot.
Retrieving contextual excerpts.


**Frontend Interface:**
A React-based user interface designed for an immersive and interactive experience.
Includes features such as real-time chat, conversation history, and accessibility enhancements.

**Persistent Conversation History:**
Chat history is stored and reused to maintain conversational continuity.
Users can revisit previous interactions for reference.
